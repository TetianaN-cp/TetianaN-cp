# Tetiana N.

Architect of transparent, predictable, and minimal PHP systems.  
Focused on architectural clarity, edge-case control, and robust documentation.

## 🛠️ Key Skills
- Architectural design and refactoring in PHP
- Float comparison, normalization, and logging
- Modular systems with predictable behavior
- Integration with external APIs (Google, Facebook, VK, Amazon)
- Workflow automation and session management

## 📦 Featured Projects
- [FloatTools](https://github.com/TetianaN-cp/FloatTools) — Transparent float handling in PHP
- [SessionGuard](https://github.com/TetianaN-cp/SessionGuard) — Minimalist PHP session manager with auto-cleanup and disk space protection.

## 📚 Philosophy
I build systems that are:
- Minimal and maintainable
- Transparent in logic and configuration
- Documented for future-proofing and clarity
I don’t know everything.
I simply build things in a way that makes everything clear — to me and to others.
